# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains Python code that predicts whether a person has a heart disease or not based on their medical history. The model used in this code is a Logistic Regression model from the Scikit-Learn library.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about patients and whether they have a heart disease or not.

## Code

The code is written in Python and uses the Scikit-Learn library to train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset. The code also splits the dataset into training and testing data, and evaluates the model's accuracy on both.

Finally, the code provides a function that takes in an array of medical data and predicts whether the person has a heart disease or not.

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply run the 'heart_disease_prediction.py' file using Python.

The output of the code will show the accuracy of the model on the training and testing data, as well as the prediction for the input data provided in the code.

## Conclusion

This code provides a simple example of how to train a machine learning model to predict whether a person has a heart disease or not based on their medical history. The code can be modified to use different models or datasets to make different predictions.
