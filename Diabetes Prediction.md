# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine Classifier

This repository contains a Python script that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on certain health factors. The dataset used for this prediction is the PIMA Diabetes Dataset.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this code:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

```
python Diabetes_prediction.py
```

## Dataset

The PIMA Diabetes Dataset used in this project contains data of females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset consists of eight medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). The predictor variables include:

1. Number of pregnancies
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age (years)

## Approach

The following steps were performed in the code to predict diabetes:

1. Data Collection and Analysis
2. Data Standardization
3. Train Test Split
4. Training the Model
5. Model Evaluation
6. Making a Predictive System

A support vector machine classifier was used for training the model.

## Predictive System

The user can input health factors for a person and the script will predict whether the person is diabetic or not.
