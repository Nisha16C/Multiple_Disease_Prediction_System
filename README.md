## Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a web-based application developed using Streamlit and Machine Learning algorithms to predict the chances of three different diseases:

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or greater version
- Streamlit library
- Scikit-learn library
- Pickle library
- Streamlit-option-menu library

## Installing

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pickle
pip install streamlit-option-menu
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nisha16C/Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System
```

2. Change the current working directory to the downloaded folder.

```bash
cd {Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System}
```

3. Install the required libraries mentioned above.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the following command to launch the Streamlit application.

```bash
streamlit run Multiple_Disease_Prediction.py
```

## Instructions

- The web application will open on your local server.
- You will see the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen.
